# --- Service Account Credentials ---
# For local development or environments outside GCP, set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
# environment variable to the path of your service account JSON key file.
# This file provides authentication for all Google Cloud client libraries (Admin SDK, Secret Manager, Vertex AI, Storage).
# Example: export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json"
# DO NOT add the path directly in this .env file if the variable is set in your shell.
# If running inside GCP (e.g., Cloud Run, GKE with Workload Identity), ADC is used automatically.

# --- Secret Manager ---
# ID of the secret in Secret Manager that stores the Gemini API Key.
GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET_ID="gemini-api-key"
# Note: The actual Gemini API Key (string) should be stored as the value of this secret in Secret Manager.

# --- Vertex AI ---
# The Vertex AI embedding model name to use for RAG.

# === Firebase ===
# Firebase Admin SDK uses GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (see above) if it's set.
# No specific Firebase variables needed here if using ADC or the common service account.

# Path where ChromaDB should persist its data within the container/filesystem.
